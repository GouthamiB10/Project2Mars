                    <p>
                        Mars has always been a source of intrigue and fascination. It is currently the only planet
                        in the Solar System on which
                        there is a strong possibility of finding the evidence of past life, perhaps even existing
                        organisms. It is also a prime candidate for future manned exploration.</p><br>
                    <p>Since beginning science operations in 2004, the mission has already provided countless
                        breath-taking views of Mars in three dimensions. It has traced the history of water across the
                        globe, demonstrating that
                        Mars once harboured environmental conditions that may have been suitable for life.
                        Key discoveries include the presence of minerals that form only in the presence of water,
                        the detection of water-ice
                        deposits underground, and evidence to suggest volcanism on Mars may have persisted until
                        recent times.</p>

                            Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet
                            where
                            we've sent rovers to roam
                            the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter
                            and
                            warmer, with a thicker
                            atmosphere, billions of years ago.</p><br>
                        <p>Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was
                            reminiscent
                            of blood. The Egyptians
                            called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one."</p><br>
                        <p>Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the
                            Martian
                            dirt oxidize, or rust, causing
                            the surface to look red.Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because
                            its reddish color was reminiscent of blood.</p>

                            With a radius of 2,106 miles, Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the
                            size
                            of a
                            nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.</p><br>
                        <p>From an average distance of 142 million miles, Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from
                            the
                            Sun. One astronomical unit, is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance,
                            it
                            takes
                            sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.</p><br>
                        <p>Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're
                            looking for signs of life
                            that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.Mars appears to have had
                            a watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well as rocks
                            and
                            minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water.</p>

                            As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very
                            similar to
                            one day on Earth. Martian days are called "solar day".
                            A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.Spring in the northern
                            hemisphere (autumn in the southern)
                            hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern winter/southern
                            summer is 154 sols.</p><br>

                        <p>Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit
                            around
                            the Sun. This is another
                            similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has
                            distinct seasons, but they last
                            longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun.And while here on
                            Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a
                            year), on
                            Mars the seasons vary in length.

                            Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. They're
                            potato-shaped because they have too
                            little mass for gravity to make them spherical.</p><br>

                        <p>Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with deep grooves on its
                            surface. It is slowly moving
                            towards Mars and will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half times farther away from
                            Mars. Oddly-shaped Deimos is
                            covered in loose dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making it appear
                            smoother
                            than pockmarked Phobos.</p>

                            The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see colors such as brown,
                            gold,
                            and tan. The reason Mars
                            looks reddish is due to oxidization – or rusting – of iron in the rocks, regolith
                            (Martian
                            “soil”), and dust of Mars.
                            This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear
                            mostly red.</p><br>

                        <p>Interestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly
                            the
                            same area as Earth’s dry land.
                            Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust
                            storms have altered the
                            landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system's most interesting
                            topographical features.There is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin
                            for liquid water to
                            exist for long on the surface.</p>

                            Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases.
                            To
                            our eyes, the sky would be
                            hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on
                            Earth.
                            Mars' sparse atmosphere
                            doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and
                            comets.</p><br>

                        <p>The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or
                            as
                            low as about -225 degrees
                            Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the
                            Sun
                            easily escapes this planet.
                            If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like
                            spring at your feet (75 degrees
                            Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0
                            degrees Celsius).</p><br>
                        <p>Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the
                            planet. After such storms, it
                            can be months before all of the dust settles.
